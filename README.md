Combining the best parts of Scrabble and Crossword

## TODO

- Allow using the keyboard (even on mobile) to enter word limiting it to what tiles the user has in their rack
- Add play against computer functionality, when a user resigns they can indicate they want their game to be completed by AI
- Words on the board should be colored by the user that played them
- Users can request a person is replaced with computer (AI) if the user then does not play in 30mins they are marked as AI
- Limit where on the board the user can select to play. Currently any tile can be clicked but it has to be at most the number of tiles the user has in their rack (7 max) including the center or distance from existing placed board tiles
- Allow users to specify the dictionary they want to play with
- Allow users to specify specific roles they want to play as
