Combining the best parts of Scrabble and Crossword

## TODO

- Detect when the last turn is played and move the game phase to ended
- Add a resign button which moves the game phase to ended
- Add play against computer functionality
- Allow using the keyboard (even on mobile) to enter word limiting it to what tiles the user has in their rack
- Add notifications when the opponent plays
- Words on the board should be colored by the user that played them
- Limit where on the board the user can select to play. Currently any tile can be clicked but it has to be at most the number of tiles the user has in their rack (7 max) including the center or distance from existing placed board tiles
- Allow users to specify the dictionary they want to play with
