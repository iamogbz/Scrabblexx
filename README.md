Combining the best parts of Scrabble and Crossword

## TODO

- Limit where on the board the user can select to play. Currently any tile can be clicked but it has to be at most the number of tiles the user has in their rack (7 max) including the center or distance from existing placed board tiles
- Words on the board should be colored by the user that played them
- Allow using the keyboard (even on mobile) to enter word limiting it to what tiles the user has in their rack
- Allow spectators to view board state without joining
