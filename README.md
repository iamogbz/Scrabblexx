## TODO

- Show list of games the user accessed on the /draw join page
- Fix the sizing of the user tiles
- Each user should have a different color assigned to them which is used for the tiles of the words they played
- The world builder should always be visible and should only be cleared by the reset turn button
  - Clearing the arrows from the board should not reset the tiles in the word builder
- Allow user to still plan words with the word builder when it is not their turn
- Limit how far from the center or existing placed board tiles the user can select to play
- Show the board multiplier in the word builder
- The word builder should show the definition of the current word
- Allow using the keyboard (even on mobile) to enter word limiting it to what tiles the user has in their rack
